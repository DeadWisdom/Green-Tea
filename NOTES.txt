Thoughts:
    - Get rid of options, they should just go on the object.
    - Should we have this be a prototype system, get rid of classes?
        If we do this, we have to support some sort of init() for actual use
        as opposed to init() for the prototype, not sure how to do that.
    - remove() should not be overloaded, there should be "remove(item)",
        and "destroy()"
    - Skins are difficult, we should change it from a class to a function
        that merely returns a jquery object, or maybe the option?
    - Should we allow chaining everywhere like in jQuery?  Or is it better
        to have a separation there, since our objects are not collections.
    - How can we better integrate with jQuery?
    - What if we assigned a source at init() with the skin, and then got rid
        of most of the isRendered()?
